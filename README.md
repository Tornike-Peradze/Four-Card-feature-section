## Overview

This is a solution to the [Four card feature section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK). It aims to create a visually appealing and visually as close as possible to the original order summary component.

### The challenge

This is a solution for the "Four card feature section" challenge from Frontend Mentor.

The challenge was to create a feature section with the following components:

- A header with a title and subtitle.
- Four boxes, each representing a feature, with an icon, title, and description.
- Each box having a distinct color scheme and border.
- The section should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

To solve this challenge, I utilized HTML and CSS to build the "Four card feature section" page. Here's a detailed overview of the code structure:

- The HTML file (index.html) contains the necessary HTML elements for the header, main content, and individual feature boxes.
- The CSS file (style.css) defines the styles to customize the appearance of the page, including the layout, typography, colors, and responsiveness.

The page is structured as follows:

- The header includes a title and subtitle to provide an introduction to the feature section.
- The main content section consists of four boxes, each representing a unique feature. Each box contains an icon, title, and description.
- The boxes are styled individually with different color schemes and border styles to create visual distinction.
- The page is designed to be responsive, ensuring that the layout and content adapt effectively to different screen sizes.

Overall, the code implements the "Four card feature section" challenge, delivering a visually appealing and responsive feature section.
